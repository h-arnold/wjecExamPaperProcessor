# WJEC Exam Paper Processor - Code Generation Instructions

## Project Context

- Tool for processing WJEC examination papers
- Functions: metadata extraction, content organization, analysis
- Input: PDF documents â†’ Output: structured text/images/metadata
- Users: educators, assessment designers, researchers

## Language and Style

- British English spelling except where syntax requires otherwise
- Indentation: 4 spaces
- Naming: camelCase (variables/functions), PascalCase (classes), UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (constants)
- Document public APIs with JSDoc

## Architecture Principles

- Separation of concerns
- DRY principle
- Async patterns for I/O operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Logging for important operations

## Domain Implementation

- WJEC exam terminology
- Paper structure: questions, sub-questions, marks
- Bilingual support (Welsh/English)
- Assessment objectives (AO1, AO2, etc.)
- Data structures for:
  - Paper ID (code, qualification, subject, component, series)
  - Structure (page/question count, marks)
  - Content (domains, objectives, question types)
  - Resources (materials, references, equipment)

## File Organization

- Group by functionality
- Descriptive naming
- Consistent structure

## Data Processing

- PDF processing for WJEC layouts
- Extract question numbering, mark patterns (e.g., "[3 marks]")
- Content domain classification via curriculum keywords
- Input validation and error handling
- WJEC-specific structure validation

## Testing

- Unit tests for critical functions
- Test fixtures for qualification levels
- Bilingual content test cases
- Validate extraction across subjects
- Edge case handling

## Output

- JSON schema following project format
- Hierarchical question structures
- Educational analysis export formats
- Proper WJEC content attribution

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Memory optimization for large papers
- Credential security
- Input sanitization
- Accessible UI components
