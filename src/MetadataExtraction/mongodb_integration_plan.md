# MongoDB Integration Action Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step action plan for integrating MongoDB into the WJEC Exam Paper Processor, consolidating the two-stage process (metadata extraction and hierarchical indexing) into a single database-driven workflow.

## Current Architecture

1. `MetadataExtractor` extracts metadata and builds flat index (`Index/index.json`)
2. `IndexManager` transforms this into hierarchical index (`Index/hierarchical_index.json`)

## Integration Goals

- Replace the intermediary JSON files with MongoDB as the primary data store
- Leverage MongoDB's query capabilities for improved performance
- Enable real-time data updates with consistent relationships
- Provide a direct database-first approach for all operations

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Set Up MongoDB Connection Management

**Estimated time**: 1-2 days

#### Methods to Create

- `DBManager.connect()` - Establish connection to MongoDB
- `DBManager.disconnect()` - Close MongoDB connection
- `DBManager.get_database()` - Return database instance

#### Methods to Modify

- None (new functionality)

#### Testing Criteria

- Connection can be established to MongoDB
- Connection string is properly read from environment variables
- Appropriate error handling for connection failures

#### Progress Log

- [x] Created connection management methods
- [x] Implemented environment variable configuration
- [x] Added error handling
- [x] Tested connection functionality

**Implementation Notes (2 May 2025):**

- Discovered that the existing `DBManager` class already had most of the required functionality
- Added `disconnect()` method as an alias for the existing `close_connection()` method to ensure naming consistency
- Added unit test for the new `disconnect()` method
- All tests now pass successfully
- Connection management fully supports environment variable configuration with appropriate defaults
- Comprehensive error handling for connection failures implemented

### Step 2: Create Basic Document Storage Functionality

**Estimated time**: 2-3 days

#### Methods to Create

- `DBManager.save_exam_metadata(metadata, document_id)` - Store extracted metadata in MongoDB
- `DBManager.get_exam_metadata(document_id)` - Retrieve a specific document
- `DBManager.delete_exam_metadata(document_id)` - Remove a document

#### Methods to Reuse

- `MetadataExtractor.extract_metadata()` - No changes needed
- `DocumentProcessor.process_document()` - Will be modified to write directly to DB

#### Testing Criteria

- Documents can be stored in MongoDB
- Documents can be retrieved by ID
- Documents can be deleted
- Proper handling of duplicate documents
- Validation of required fields

#### Progress Log

- [x] Implemented save functionality
- [x] Implemented retrieval functionality
- [x] Implemented deletion functionality
- [x] Added validation logic
- [x] Created tests for CRUD operations

**Implementation Notes (2 May 2025):**

- Implemented three core methods for handling exam metadata:
  - `save_exam_metadata(metadata, document_id)` - For storing metadata in MongoDB
  - `get_exam_metadata(document_id)` - For retrieving documents by ID
  - `delete_exam_metadata(document_id)` - For removing documents
- Added a utility method `document_exists(document_id)` to check if a document already exists in the database
- Implemented validation for required fields in metadata ('subject', 'qualification', 'year', 'season', 'unit')
- Added automatic generation of document IDs when not explicitly provided
- Created comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases covering all methods
- All methods include proper error handling and logging
- Updated datetime handling to use timezone-aware objects (datetime.datetime.now(UTC)) as per best practices
- Fixed a bug with pymongo datetime handling
- All 24 tests now pass successfully without warnings
