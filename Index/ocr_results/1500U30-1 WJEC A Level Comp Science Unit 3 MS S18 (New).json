        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2018 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

Programming languages are subject to continuous development resulting in multiple versions that are often not fully compatible with each other. Standardisation aims to avoid these incompatibilities and provide advantages in design and programming such as; |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Portability of programs. There is a high possibility that applications written for a particular hardware platform may be used on different platforms if the applications were developed in a standardised language because compilers/interpreters for standardised languages exist for diverse hardware platforms. |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Portability of programmers. A programming language is an interface between the programmer and the computing system or a hardware platform. If the different platforms support a standard programming interface, then the skills of the programmer is portable across these platforms. |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Easier to maintain the software. Most software requires continuous maintenance and enhancements after the original release. Most of the time, different programmers work on such maintenance tasks. A standardised language ensures that there will be sufficient skilled programmers available to carry out maintenance tasks. |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Acceptability. Most business organisations would not consider using a programming language that is not standardised. A non-standardised language is a big risk for business-critical software development. |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Faster development. Standardisation promotes standard ways of working and therefore speeds up team working in development. |  |  |  |  |\n|  | Standard library. In addition to the particular programming language, a common set of library functions for that language may be standardised, to support \"generic programming\".
