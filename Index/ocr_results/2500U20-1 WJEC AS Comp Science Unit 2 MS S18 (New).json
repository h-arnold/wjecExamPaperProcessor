        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2018 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

        "markdown": "# WJEC <br> GCE A Level Computer Science - Unit 2 \n\n## Summer 2018 Mark Scheme\n\n## Positive marking\n\nIt should be remembered that learners are writing under examination conditions and credit should be given for what the learner writes, rather than adopting the approach of penalising him/her for any omissions. It should be possible for a very good response to achieve full marks and a very poor one to achieve zero marks. Marks should not be deducted for a less than perfect answer if it satisfies the criteria of the mark scheme.\n\nFor questions that are objective or points-based the mark scheme should be applied precisely. Marks should be awarded as indicated and no further subdivision made.\n\nFor band marked questions mark schemes are in two parts.\nPart 1 is advice on the indicative content that suggests the range of computer science concepts, theory, issues and arguments which may be included in the learner's answers. These can be used to assess the quality of the learner's response.\n\nPart 2 is an assessment grid advising bands and associated marks that should be given to responses which demonstrate the qualities needed in AO1, AO2 and AO3. Where a response is not credit worthy or not attempted it is indicated on the grid as mark band zero.\n\n## Banded mark schemes\n\nBanded mark schemes are divided so that each band has a relevant descriptor. The descriptor for the band provides a description of the performance level for that band. Each band contains marks.\n\nExaminers should first read and annotate a learner's answer to pick out the evidence that is being assessed in that question. Once the annotation is complete, the mark scheme can be applied.\n\nThis is done as a two-stage process.\n\n## Stage 1 - Deciding on the band\n\nWhen deciding on a band, the answer should be viewed holistically. Beginning at the lowest band, examiners should look at the learner's answer and check whether it matches the descriptor for that band. Examiners should look at the descriptor for that band and see if it matches the qualities shown in the learner's answer. If the descriptor at the lowest band is satisfied, examiners should move up to the next band and repeat this process for each band until the descriptor matches the answer.\n\nIf an answer covers different aspects of different bands within the mark scheme, a 'best fit' approach should be adopted to decide on the band and then the learner's response should be used to decide on the mark within the band. For instance, if a response is mainly in band 2 but with a limited amount of band 3 content, the answer would be placed in band 2, but the mark awarded would be close to the top of band 2 as a result of the band 3 content. Examiners should not seek to mark candidates down as a result of small omissions in minor areas of an answer.",

        "markdown": "# Stage 2 - Deciding on the mark \n\nOnce the band has been decided, examiners can then assign a mark. During standardising (marking conference), detailed advice from the Principal Examiner on the qualities of each mark band will be given. Examiners will then receive examples of answers in each mark band that have been awarded a mark by the Principal Examiner. Examiners should mark the examples and compare their marks with those of the Principal Examiner.\n\nWhen marking, examiners can use these examples to decide whether a learner's response is of a superior, inferior or comparable standard to the example. Examiners are reminded of the need to revisit the answer as they apply the mark scheme in order to confirm that the band and the mark allocated is appropriate to the response provided.\n\nIndicative content is also provided for banded mark schemes. Indicative content is not exhaustive, and any other valid points must be credited. In order to reach the highest bands of the mark scheme a learner need not cover all of the points mentioned in the indicative content but must meet the requirements of the highest mark band. Where a response is not creditworthy, that is contains nothing of any significance to the mark scheme, or where no response has been provided, no marks should be awarded.",
