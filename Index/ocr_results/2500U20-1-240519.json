It offers training sessions for different age and ability groups.\n\nKimsKarate employs several instructors and currently records its data on paper.\nKimsKarate wants a computerised system, which will allow the club to store details of its instructors, the groups they take and the pupils enrolled in each group.\n\nCurrently a single instructor can be responsible for many groups, and a group has many pupils. Pupils can only be enrolled in one group at a time and there is always a single instructor responsible for that group.\n\nThe main requirements of the new computer system for KimsKarate are:\n\n- The ability to store details on instructors, groups and pupils.\n- The ability to calculate pupils' grades based on test results.\n- The ability to accept electronic payment for training sessions in the future.\n- The ability to carry out simple calculations, such as to calculate the total price of several session fees.\n\nKimsKarate intends to use the following tables to store data:\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)",
