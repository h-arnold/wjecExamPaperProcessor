(a) A series of calculations must be carried out to complete a process:\n\nTask 1: $a=b x+c y$\nTask 2: $d=e x+t^{2}$\nTask 3: $g=$ hy -d\nExplain why these tasks are not suitable for parallel processing.\n(b) A computer model is to be used to predict economic forecasts for an industrialised country. The model involves many complex calculations. It is estimated that it will take 16 hours to run on a single processor computer.\n$80 \\%$ of the algorithm can be carried out in parallel. The remaining parts of the algorithm must be carried out serially.\n\nDetermine the time taken to run the parallel processing elements of the economic forecast model on a parallel processing system using 8 processors.\n3. In a food factory, packages are filled as they travel along a conveyor belt. The packages are weighed and any underweight packages are rejected.\n\nA control program for the weighing system is to be written in assembly language. The minimum acceptable weight is stored in memory location $\\mathbf{R}$. The required algorithm is:\n\n# LOOP continuously \n\ninput package weight\nsubtract the value stored in location $\\mathbf{R}$ from the input weight\nIF the remainder is zero or greater THEN\noutput value 1\nELSE\noutput value 2\nENDIF\nEND LOOP",

The number of different stock items held by the shop is currently 95 .\n\nA programmer considers two different methods of storing the stock records:\n\n- A direct access file with 100 storage locations. The location for each item is calculated using the hash function: identificationCode MOD 100.\n- A sequential access file with 1000 storage locations. The stock record is stored at the location corresponding to its identification code, so product 715 will be stored at location 715 .\n\nExplain the advantages and disadvantages of these two methods.\n8. Describe the three basic states of a process in a multi-tasking computer.\n9. Improved worker safety is a benefit of automation.\n(a) Describe two other benefits and two drawbacks of automating a manufacturing process.\n(b) Explain, giving an example of each type of system, the main purpose of:\n\n- a safety related control system\n- a safety critical control system.",

When a major project is carried out, employees from the departments need to work together.\n(a) The company currently uses a single flat file to store all details of the projects. They have discovered that the data structure has several shortcomings.\nDescribe two disadvantages for the company of using a flat file to store its data.\n(b) The company has decided to develop a relational database to store details of the projects. Each project will have a title and a project budget. Project teams will be made up of employees from various departments. Each time an employee joins the company they will be allocated to the department that matches their skills. An employee may be a member of more than one project team.\n\nDesign a database system in third normal form for this situation.",
