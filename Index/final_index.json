The program code can then usually be executed one line at a time. This is called single-stepping\n- Variable watch: this is a facility which displays the current value of any variable. The value can be 'watched' as the program code is single-stepped to see the effects of the code on the variable. Alternatively a variable watch may be set, which will interrupt the program flow if the watched variable reaches a specified value\n- Memory inspector: this is a facility which will display the contents of a section of memory\n- Error diagnostics: these are used when a program fails to compile or to run. Error messages are displayed to help the programmer diagnose what has gone wrong\n- Emulator: will provide an emulator to run the code/app so no physical device required\n- Context sensitive menu: IDE suggests available options\n- Statement completion: IDE will complete a statement such as adding an 'end if' to an 'if' statement\n- GUI creation: Allows programmer to create a GUI by dragging and dropping controls (buttons, etc...) onto a form.\n- Publisher: facility to package up and deploy program as an easy to install package\n- Code optimisation: Warning message when variables have been declared but not used.\nAccept use of IDE/SDE/SDK interchangeably",

Section B: Select the programming language of your choice from section BI, BII or BIII and answer all questions within your chosen section. You are advised to spend no more than 60 minutes on this section. You will be required to develop programs that solve computing problems referring to the initial scenario. The number of marks is given in brackets at the end of each question or part-question. The total number of marks available is 60.
