You will be required to analyse and deconstruct the scenario to consider its component parts in terms that can be addressed through automated computation. Section B: Select the programming language of your choice from section BI, BII or BIII and answer all questions within your chosen section. You are advised to spend no more than 60 minutes on this section. You will be required to develop programs that solve computing problems referring to the initial scenario. The number of marks is given in brackets at the end of each question or part-question. The total number of marks available is 60.
