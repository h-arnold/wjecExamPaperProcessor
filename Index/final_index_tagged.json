The program code can then usually be executed one line at a time. This is called single-stepping\n- Variable watch: this is a facility which displays the current value of any variable. The value can be 'watched' as the program code is single-stepped to see the effects of the code on the variable. Alternatively a variable watch may be set, which will interrupt the program flow if the watched variable reaches a specified value\n- Memory inspector: this is a facility which will display the contents of a section of memory\n- Error diagnostics: these are used when a program fails to compile or to run. Error messages are displayed to help the programmer diagnose what has gone wrong\n- Emulator: will provide an emulator to run the code/app so no physical device required\n- Context sensitive menu: IDE suggests available options\n- Statement completion: IDE will complete a statement such as adding an 'end if' to an 'if' statement\n- GUI creation: Allows programmer to create a GUI by dragging and dropping controls (buttons, etc...) onto a form.\n- Publisher: facility to package up and deploy program as an easy to install package\n- Code optimisation: Warning message when variables have been declared but not used.\nAccept use of IDE/SDE/SDK interchangeably",
