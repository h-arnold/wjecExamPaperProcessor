A file manager program provides an interface to a computer's file system.\n(a) Describe how files may be organised and managed using a file manager program.\n(b) Files may be organised using a hashing algorithm. Explain the purpose of a hashing algorithm.\n2. Interrupts are often generated in a computer system.\n(a) Identify a situation in which a high-priority interrupt may be generated.\n(b) Describe the procedure for dealing with an interrupt with a higher priority than the interrupt that is currently being processed.\n3. An assembly language program is required to check a four digit numeric code against a code stored in location $Y$.\n\nIf the code is entered correctly then the program should output 1. If the code entered is incorrect the program should output 2 and should allow the user to re-enter a code.\n\nThe assembly language used by the processor has an instruction set which includes the following commands:\n\n| Assembly Language Command | Description |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| INP | Input numeric value to the accumulator |\n| OUT X | Output a numeric value X |\n| STA X | Copy contents of accumulator to memory <br> location $X$ |\n| LDA X | Load accumulator with contents of memory <br> location $X$ |\n| HLT | End |\n| SUB Y | Subtract the numeric value in location $Y$ from the <br> accumulator, leaving the result in the accumulator |\n| JZE LABEL | Jump to LABEL if the contents of the <br> accumulator are equal to zero |\n| JMP LABEL | Jump unconditionally to LABEL |\n\nUsing the instruction set, write a program to check the code entered.",

Delays represent the overhead arising from the time taken for a router to process, queue and transmit a data packet.\n\nThe total route cost is calculated as the cost of each link multiplied by the total of the delay factors of each intermediate router visited.\n\nThis is a diagram of the network. The delay at each intermediate router $=1.2$.\n![img-0.jpeg](img-0.jpeg)\n(a) Calculate the lowest cost route from router $A$ to router $F$.\n(b) (i) A new link of bandwidth cost $=14$ is to be added from $B$ to $F$. Re-calculate the lowest cost route from router $A$ to router $F$.\n(ii) The link from router $C$ to router $D$ is then upgraded to a network cost of 5 . Describe the effect the upgrade will have on overall network costs.\n7. Phishing is the most common cyber-attack vector.\n(a) Explain what is meant by the term 'cyber-attack vector'.\n(b) Describe two other cyber-attack vectors.\n8.
