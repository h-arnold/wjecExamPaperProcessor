        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2022 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

The significance increases as the level of parallelisation achieved in the software increases. | $\\begin{aligned} & 1 \\\\ & 1 \\\\ & 1 \\\\ & 1 \\end{aligned}$ |  | $\\begin{aligned} & 2 b \\\\ & 2 b \\\\ & 2 b \\\\ & 2 b \\end{aligned}$ |  |  |",

For medical laboratories, privacy is a paramount concern. Medical laboratories have a legal and ethical obligation to protect patients' confidentiality. The information present in these laboratories is sensitive, and the repercussions of stolen information can be far-reaching. <br> - Two biometric properties are used for authentication. Physical biometrics include DNA, fingerprints, facial recognition, and eye scans (iris, retina). Behavioural biometrics include voice recognition and handwritten signatures. <br> - A biometric device is a security identification and authentication device. Such devices use automated methods of verifying or recognising the identity of a living person-based characteristics, such as fingerprints, facial images, iris and voice recognition. <br> Stages <br> - Measurement, signal processing, pattern matching, and decision making. <br> - Measurement involves sensing biometric characteristics and is necessary both for the creation of the reference model and for each authentication trial. <br> - Example, voice verification involves recording one's voice through a microphone. Then the digital data are mathematically modelled. When the user wants to be authenticated, the device compares the received data to the user model and makes a decision. <br> Accuracy <br> Not 100\\% accurate. There are two types of errors in a typical biometric system. <br> - A false reject (FR) error is the rejection of an authorised person. <br> - A false accept (FA) error is the acceptance of a person who is not in fact who they claim to be. <br> - Advantages include Improved security, better user experience, passwords cannot be forgotten, or access cards lost. | 9 |  | 2b |  | 9 |",

They are considered to be highly effective. <br> - Improvement over iris scanners is that retinal scanners are capable of authenticating those who are blind, or those who have lack of pigment in the iris. <br> - Invasive in nature as they require the person who is being authenticated to be very close to the device itself, <br> Voice print recognition. <br> - Considered a behavioural based biometric device because typically the focus of voice recognition is on how a person speaks, and not what they say. <br> - These devices often measure pauses, accents, as well as what the person says. <br> - Typically used in situations which only have a few authenticated users. <br> - Subject to errors arising from several factors, including background noise. |  |  |  |  |  |  |",
