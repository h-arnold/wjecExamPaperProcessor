(a) (i) A programmer chooses to use a random access file system with separate overflow area to store records.\n\nExplain what is meant by an overflow area.\n(ii) Another programmer recommends using the following progressive overflow strategy:\n\n- If the memory location calculated for storing a record is already occupied, the record is stored within the main file in the next available empty location in the sequence.\n- If the end of the main file is reached whilst searching for an available location, the search continues from the beginning of the main file.\n\nGive one advantage and one disadvantage of using this progressive overflow strategy compared with a separate overflow area.\n(b) Daily sales records are stored in a random access file. The key field of each record consists of three letters representing the month, followed by two numbers representing the day, and two numbers representing the year, e.g. a record for 8 October 2018 would have the key field: OCT0818\n\nThe file has 1000 memory locations, numbered 0 - 999.\nA hashing method is considered for the file:\n\n- Take the alphabet sequence number of each letter and add them together.\n- Add the day number.\n- Add the year number.\n- Calculate the memory location using the hash function: total MOD 1000\n\nFor example:\nMAR2418 $=>13+1+18+24+18=74$\n74 MOD $1000=74$\nSo the record is stored in location 74\n(i) The largest number generated by this hashing method is given by NOV3099. Calculate the memory location for this date.\n(ii) Explain why this would be an unsuitable hashing method.\n(iii) Suggest an improved hashing method for storing records with key fields in the same format e.g. OCT0322.",

Explain how these could be used in the safe transfer of data over the internet.\n(b) A method of encrypting text is the Caesar cypher. Each letter is moved forward in the alphabet by a fixed number of places using modulo 26 arithmetic. For example, using a shift of 5 places, W becomes B.\n\nState why messages using the Caesar cypher can be decrypted easily by an unauthorised person.\n(c) Two members of staff in a law firm decide to exchange a confidential message over the Internet using a stream cypher method:\n\n- Letters in the original message are shifted forward by a specified number of positions in the alphabet using modulo 26 arithmetic, but each character in the message is moved forward by a different number of letters.\n- The shifts for the first two letters in the message have been agreed:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\operatorname{shift}[1]=4 \\\\\n& \\operatorname{shift}[2]=3\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n- The letter shifts for each following letter in the message are calculated with the formula:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{shift}[N+2]=\\operatorname{shift}[N]+2 \\text { times } \\operatorname{shift}[N+1]\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{N}=$ (position of the letter in the message) -2\nIn this way, for the third letter,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{shift}[3]=\\operatorname{shift}[1]+2 \\times \\operatorname{shift}[2]=4+(2 \\times 3)=10\n$$\n\n- Modulo 26 arithmetic is again used.
