The company wants a computerised job booking system, which will allow clients to book a job.\n\nClients will be able to access pricing and time estimates via an online computer system or by speaking to a member of staff who will access the system and provide quotes for the client.\n\nThis new system will store details of clients. The system will also store details of the different plumbers' call-out rates and hourly working rates. The system will provide a simple job booking facility, where clients choose a specific plumber, based on their expertise with the particular job the client requires.\n\nThe main requirements of the new computer system for Pete's Plumbers are:\n\n- The ability to store and search client details\n- The ability to store plumbers' details and search for plumbers using various attributes, such as; search for all \"drainage specialists\" or all \"gas safe heating qualified plumbers\", search by call-out price of plumber, search by hourly rates, search by number of years' experience, or search by first name or surname\n- The ability to calculate an estimated price for a job.\n\nPete's Plumbers has the following partially completed entity-relationship diagram as an overview of the system they would like to create:\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)",

Copy and complete the entity relationship diagram provided in the scenario.\n2. Draw two data structure tables that will allow Pete's Plumbers to store clients' and plumbers' details.\n[10]\n3. Construct a flowchart for the process of searching a list (for example a list of plumbers) for a search item. If the item is found the flowchart should output the location in the list where the item was found. If the item is not found the flowchart should output \"Not Found\".\n[8]\n4. Select and fully justify your proposed method of solution for the three main requirements listed in the scenario.\n5. Pete's Plumbers will have to consider different methods of backing up its data.\n\nPete's Plumbers is a small company with limited data. Describe different procedures Pete's Plumbers could use for backing up and recovering data. You should explain why the different backup methods are suitable for Pete's Plumbers. Your answer should include three different secondary storage devices Pete's Plumbers could use.",
