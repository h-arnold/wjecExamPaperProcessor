        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2022 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

Award a maximum of two marks for benefits and two for drawbacks.: <br> - Touch screen <br> - Most operating systems now use touch screens, normally capacitive touch, as the key form of input. <br> - Capacitive touch screens work on the principle that the human body is an electronic conductor. When you press on a capacitive screen it distorts the electromagnetic field of the screen which is then measured as a change in capacitance. This is then translated into $x$ and $y$ coordinates for the device. <br> - Touch screens allow for the use of gestures, such as a swipe, to perform actions. These gestures are intuitive to the user, such as pinching to make something smaller. <br> - Very intuitive <br> - Easier to use as the user simply touches what is seen on the display <br> - No keyboard or mouse is required <br> - Touching a visual display of choices requires little thinking and is a form of direct manipulation that is easy to learn <br> - Easier hand-eye coordination than mice or keyboards <br> However <br> - Screen can be easily damaged/scratched <br> - Dirty screens are difficult to read <br> - Users must be within arm's reach of the display <br> - It is difficult to select small items <br> - User's hand may obscure the screen <br> - Screens need to be installed at a lower position and tilted to reduce arm fatigue <br> - Some reduction in image brightness may occur. | 4 | 1.1 b |  |  | 4 |",

It can draw on a wide variety of sources such as stored knowledge from books case studies to help in diagnosis and advice. <br> - The computer does not 'forget' or make mistakes. <br> - Data can be kept up-to-date. <br> - The expert system is always available 24 hours a day and will never 'retire'. <br> - The system can be used at a distance over a network. So rural areas or even poorer third world countries have access to experts. <br> - Provides accurate predictions with probabilities of all possible problems with more accurate advice. <br> - Some people prefer the privacy of talking to a computer. <br> Disadvantages: <br> - Over reliance upon computers <br> - Some employees could be de-skilled by over dependence upon computer advice. <br> - Fewer medical staff could be needed <br> - Lacks the 'human touch'! - lack of personal contact <br> - Dependent upon the correct information being given.
