        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2023 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

This is important as the FTP protocol has in-built error checking and re-transmission request as necessary (1). <br> Name: Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) (1) <br> Description: allows the transfer of multimedia webpages over the internet (1). This is important as the HTTP protocol allows multiple different web browsers to display and format web pages as the original author intended (1). <br> Name: Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP) (1) <br> Description: allows emails to be sent over a network <br> (1). This is important as the SMTP provides a standard way of transferring emails between two different servers (1). <br> Name: Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) (1) <br> Description: allows emails to be transferred between computer systems (via the internet) (1). This is important as the IMAP provides a standard way of transferring emails between two different servers / messages are stored on the server instead of mobile devices, which saves storage space (1). <br> Name: Dynamic host control protocol (1) (DHCP) <br> Description: assigns dynamic IP addresses to devices on a network (1). This is important as the DHCP protocol allows addresses no longer in use to be automatically returned to the pool of available IP addresses for reallocation (1). <br> Name: Universal datagram protocol (UDP) (1) <br> Description: sends datagrams across a network with very few error recovery services. (1). This is important as, for example, video and audio streaming protocols are designed to handle occasional lost packets and need to receive new packets rather than the retransmission of previous ones (1). <br> Name: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) (1) <br> Description: allows any networked computers to communicate with each other (1) This is important as TCP/IP specifies how signals are routed and transported around a network (and reduces the need for gateways to convert signals into different protocols).

They are to fix problems, without breaking the system or adding functionality. <br> - Perfective maintenance <br> - Perfective maintenance is maintenance performed with the aim of achieving a perfect system. <br> - In order to make the system perfect, it will be necessary to fix all problems. If new or changed requirements are identified and agreed, upgrades must also be provided to implement them. <br> - Perfective maintenance also requires that performance is improved when possible.
