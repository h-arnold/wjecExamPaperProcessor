The company offers a range of luxury holiday caravans for hire.\n\nLlaethFarm Caravan Park wants to improve the management of the holidays and has decided to install a new computer based booking system. Staff of LlaethFarm Caravan Park will use the new computer system to book specific caravans and calculate end of holiday charges.\n\nThe main requirements of the new computer system for LlaethFarm Caravan Park are to:\n\n- store and search customer details\n- store and search caravan details and availability\n- enable different members of staff to view and change different items of data\n- carry out simple calculations, such as the cost of WiFi, or additional charges for gas used during extended stays.\n\nLlaethFarm Caravan Park has the following partially completed entity-relationship diagram as an overview of the system they would like to create:\n![img-1.jpeg](img-1.jpeg)",

Copy and complete the entity relationship diagram provided in the scenario.\n2. Draw two data structure tables that will allow LlaethFarm Caravan Park to store customers' details and details of bookings.\n[10]\n3. Construct a flowchart for the process of searching a list, such as a list of caravans, for a search item. If the item is found the flowchart should output the location in the list where the item was found. If the item is not found the flowchart should output \"Not Found\".\n[8]\n4. Select and fully justify a method of solution for the main requirements listed in the scenario. [6]\n5. LlaethFarm Caravan Park would like to allow different views of the data to different members of staff. The company has employees which are assigned to 4 groups with differing access rights to the tables provided in the scenario. These groups are: managers, receptionists, groundkeepers, and cleaners.\n\nDescribe the level of access to LlaethFarm Caravan Park's database tables that should be granted to each group of employees.\n6. LlaethFarm Caravan Park stores the details of its caravans' daily charge in a sorted array (lowest to highest). They understand that a binary search can be used to find the location of an item in the array.\n\nUsing a recognised convention, write an algorithm that performs a binary search on a presorted array of positive integers.\n\nThe algorithm should accept the following inputs:\n\n- The pre-sorted array: cArray[9999]\n- The data item to search: searchValue\n\n\n## The algorithm should output:\n\n- The location in the array of the searchValue\n- A message such as \"item not found\" if the item is not located.",
