        "markdown": "# INTRODUCTION \n\nThis marking scheme was used by WJEC for the 2017 examination. It was finalised after detailed discussion at examiners' conferences by all the examiners involved in the assessment. The conference was held shortly after the paper was taken so that reference could be made to the full range of candidates' responses, with photocopied scripts forming the basis of discussion. The aim of the conference was to ensure that the marking scheme was interpreted and applied in the same way by all examiners.\n\nIt is hoped that this information will be of assistance to centres but it is recognised at the same time that, without the benefit of participation in the examiners' conference, teachers may have different views on certain matters of detail or interpretation.\n\nWJEC regrets that it cannot enter into any discussion or correspondence about this marking scheme.",

A problem in one site will not stop other sites from working. <br> - Security. Staff access can be limited to only their portion of the database. <br> - Network traffic is reduced so reducing bandwidth costs. <br> - A single site database still works even if the connection between sites is temporarily broken). <br> - Scaling: If demand increases then it is straight forward to add an extra node to the distributed database. (A large company, the demand will likely increase/decrease when a market changes and the system can be scaled quickly). <br> - High performance: Queries and updates are largely local so the there is no network bottleneck (The queries/updates are likely to be local to the sites, and there will be no local bottlenecking). <br> - Expense: either cheaper or more expensive but has to be properly qualified | 5 | 1.1b |  |  | 5 |",
